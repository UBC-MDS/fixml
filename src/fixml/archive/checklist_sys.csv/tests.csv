2.1,Data Presence,Test Data Fetching and File Reading,"Verify that the data fetching API or data file reading functionality works correctly. Ensure that proper error handling is in place for scenarios such as missing files, incorrect file formats, and network errors.","Ensure that the code responsible for fetching or reading data can handle errors. This means if the file is missing, the format is wrong, or there's a network issue, the system should not crash but should provide a clear error message indicating the problem.",(general knowledge)
3.1,Data Quality,Validate Data Shape and Values,"Check that the data has the expected shape and that all values meet domain-specific constraints, such as non-negative distances.","Check that the data being used has the correct structure (like having the right number of columns) and that the values within the data make sense (e.g., distances should not be negative). This ensures that the data is valid and reliable for model training.","alexander2024Evaluating, ISO/IEC5259"
3.2,Data Quality,Check for Duplicate Records in Data,Check for duplicate records in the dataset and ensure that there are none.,"Ensure that the dataset does not contain duplicate entries, as these can skew the results and reduce the model's performance. The test should identify any repeated records so they can be removed or investigated.",ISO/IEC5259
4.1,Data Ingestion,Verify Data Split Proportion,Check that the data is split into training and testing sets in the expected proportion.,"Confirm that the data is divided correctly into training and testing sets according to the intended ratio. This is crucial for ensuring that the model is trained and evaluated properly, with representative samples in each set.","openja2023studying, DBLP:conf/recsys/Kula15, singh2020mmf"
5.1,Model Fitting,Test Model Output Shape,Validate that the model's output has the expected shape.,"Ensure that the output from the model has the correct dimensions and structure. For example, in a classification task, if the model should output probabilities for each class, the test should verify that the output is an array with the correct dimensions. Ensuring the correct output shape helps prevent runtime errors and ensures consistency in how data is handled downstream.","openja2023studying, DBLP:conf/recsys/Kula15, singh2020mmf"
6.1,Model Evaluation,Verify Evaluation Metrics Implementation,Verify that the evaluation metrics are correctly implemented and appropriate for the model's task.,Confirm that the metrics used to evaluate the model are implemented correctly and are suitable for the specific task at hand. This helps in accurately assessing the model's performance and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.,"openja2023studying, DBLP:conf/recsys/Kula15, singh2020mmf"
6.2,Model Evaluation,Evaluate Model's Performance Against Thresholds,"Compute evaluation metrics for both the training and testing datasets and ensure that these metrics exceed predefined threshold values, indicating acceptable model performance.","This ensures that the model's performance meets or exceeds certain benchmarks. By setting thresholds for metrics like accuracy or precision, you can automatically flag models that underperform or overfit. This is crucial for maintaining a baseline quality of results and for ensuring that the model meets the requirements necessary for deployment.","openja2023studying, DBLP:conf/recsys/Kula15, singh2020mmf"
8.1,Data Quality (Optional),Validate Outliers Detection and Handling,Detect outliers in the dataset. Ensure that the outlier detection mechanism is sensitive enough to flag true outliers while ignoring minor anomalies.,The detection method should be precise enough to catch significant anomalies without being misled by minor variations. This is important for maintaining data quality and ensuring the model's reliability in certain projects.,ISO/IEC5259
