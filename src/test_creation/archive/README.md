## NOTE

This `archive/` is for the F-score comparison between the code in week 3 (before refactoring, i.e. old code base, by 2024-05-17) vs. week 4 (after refactoring by 2024-05-24). We have to keep the old code base (archive/analyze.py) and adjust the ConsistencyEvaluator (archive/llm_eval/consistency_eval.py) so that it also works for the old code.

We want to keep a record of the above comparison in case someone might ask for it.

We may delete this folder in the future when we are having a comparison between newer versions. For now, we put those related to the demo and the old code base under `archive/` in order not to disturb the latest code base.
