Title: Checklist for Tests in Machine Learning Projects
# TODO: To be filled in later...
Description: Description about the project and its context
Test Areas:
  - ID: "1"
    Topic: General
    Description: >-
      The following items describe best practices for all tests to be written.
    Tests:
      - ID: "1.1"
        Title: Write Descriptive Test Names
        Requirement: >-
          Each test function should have a clear, descriptive name that
          accurately reflects the test's purpose and the specific functionality
          or scenario it examines.
        Explanation: >-
          If out tests are narrow and sufficiently descriptive, the test name
          itself may give us enough information to start debugging. This also
          helps us to identify what is being tested inside the function.

      - ID: "1.2"
        Title: Keep Tests Focused
        Requirement: >-
          Each test should focus on a single scenario, using only one set of
          mock data and testing one specific behavior or outcome to ensure
          clarity and isolate issues.
        Explanation: >-
          If we test multiple scenarios in a single test, it is hard to idenitfy
          exactly what went wrong. Keeping one scenario in a single test helps
          us to isolate problematic scenarios.

    Topic: Data Presence
    Description: >-
      The following items describe tests that need to be done for testing the
      presence of data. This area of tests mainly concern whether the reading
      and saving operations are behaving as expected, and any unexpected
      behavior would not be passed silently.
    Tests:
      - ID: "2.1"
        Title: Ensure Data File Loads as Expected
        Requirement: >-
          Ensure that data-loading functions correctly load files when they
          exist and match the expected format, handle non-existent files
          appropriately, and return the expected results.
        Explanation: >-
          Reading data is a common scenario encountered in ML projects.  This
          item ensures that the data exists and can be loaded with expected
          format, and gracefully exit when unable to load the data.

    Topic: Model Fitting
    Description: >-
      The following items describe tests that need to be done for testing the
      model fitting process. The unit tests written for this section usually
      mock model load and model predictions similarly to mocking file access.
    Tests:
      - ID: "5.1"
        Title: Validate Model Input and Output Compatibility
        Requirement: >-
          Confirm that the model accepts inputs of the correct shapes and types
          and produces outputs that meet the expected shapes and types without
          any errors.
        Explanation: >-
          Ensuring that inputs and outputs conform to expected specifications
          is critical for the correct functioning of the model in a production
          environment.
