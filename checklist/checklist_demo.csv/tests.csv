1.1,General,Write Descriptive Test Names,"Each test function should have a clear, descriptive name that accurately reflects the test's purpose and the specific functionality or scenario it examines.","If out tests are narrow and sufficiently descriptive, the test name itself may give us enough information to start debugging. This also helps us to identify what is being tested inside the function.","trenk2014, winters2024"
1.2,General,Keep Tests Focused,"Each test should focus on a single scenario, using only one set of mock data and testing one specific behavior or outcome to ensure clarity and isolate issues.","If we test multiple scenarios in a single test, it is hard to idenitfy exactly what went wrong. Keeping one scenario in a single test helps us to isolate problematic scenarios.",yu2018
2.1,Data Presence,Ensure Data File Loads as Expected,"Ensure that data-loading functions correctly load files when they exist and match the expected format, handle non-existent files appropriately, and return the expected results.","Reading data is a common scenario encountered in ML projects.  This item ensures that the data exists and can be loaded with expected format, and gracefully exit when unable to load the data.",msise2023
5.1,Model Fitting,Validate Model Input and Output Compatibility,Confirm that the model accepts inputs of the correct shapes and types and produces outputs that meet the expected shapes and types without any errors.,Ensuring that inputs and outputs conform to expected specifications is critical for the correct functioning of the model in a production environment.,msise2023
