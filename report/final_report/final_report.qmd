# Final Report - Checklists and LLM prompts for efficient and effective test creation in data analysis

by John Shiu, Orix Au Yeung, Tony Shum, Yingzi Jin

## Executive Summary

The global AI market is expanding rapidly and demanding for robust quality assurance for ML systems to prevent risks such as misinformation, social bias, financial losses, and safety hazards. FixML addresses these challenges by offering an automated code review tool embedded with best practices for ML test suites, curated from ML research and industry standards.

Our approach includes developing the tool in Python package based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and creating comprehensive checklists to enhance ML software's trustworthiness, quality, and reproducibility. The tool analyzes ML projects, compares test suites against best practices, and delivers evaluations, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual assessments.

To ensure reliability, we defined two success metrics: accuracy (comparison with human expert judgments) and consistency (standard deviation across multiple runs). Our findings indicated that while our tool is effective, there is room to improce in both metrics, which requires further prompt engineering and refinement for enhanced performance.

The FixML package is available on PyPI and can be used as a CLI tool and a high-level API, which makes it user-friendly and versatile. Future improvements will focus on specialized checklists, enhanced evaluators, customized test specifications, workflow and performance optimization to further improve ML system quality and user experience.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

The global artificial intelligence (AI) market is growing exponentially [@grand2021artificial], driven by its ability to autonomously make complex decisions impacting various aspects of human life, including financial transactions, autonomous transportation, and medical diagnosis.

However, ensuring the software quality of these systems remains a significant challenge [@openja2023studying]. Specifically, the lack of a standardized and comprehensive approach to testing machine learning (ML) systems introduces potential risks to stakeholders. For example, inadequate quality assurance in ML systems can lead to severe consequences, such as misinformation [@Ashley2024], social bias [@Alice2023], substantial financial losses [@Asheeta2019] and safety hazards [@David2023]

Therefore, defining and promoting an industry standard and establishing robust testing methodologies for these systems is crucial. But how?

### Our Objectives

We propose to develop testing suites diagnostic tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and curate checklists based on ML research papers and best practices to facilitate comprehensive testing of ML systems with flexibility. Our goal is to enhance applied ML software's trustworthiness, quality, and reproducibility across both the industry and academia [@kapoor2022leakage].

## Data Science Methods

### Current Approaches

To ensure the reproducibility, trustworthiness, and lack of bias in ML systems, comprehensive testing is essential. We outlined some traditional approaches for assessing the completeness of ML system tests with their advantages and drawbacks as follows.

1. **Code Coverage**

Code coverage measures the proportion of source code of a program executed when a particular test suite is run. Widely used in software development, it quantifies test quality and is scalable due to its short processing time. However, it cannot indicate the reasons or specific ML areas where the test suites fall short under the context of ML system development.

2. **Manual Evaluation**

Manual evaluation involves human experts reviewing the source code, whom can take the business logic into considerations and identify vulnerabilites. It often provides context-specific improvement suggestions and remains one of the most reliable practices [@openja2023studying], [@alexander2023evaluating]. However, it is time-consuming and not scalable due to the scarcity of human experts. Moreover, different experts might put emphasis on different ML test areas and lack a comprehensive and holistic review of the ML system test suites.

### Our Approach

Our approach is to deliver an automated code review tool with the best practices of ML test suites embedded. This tool aims to educate ML users on best practices while providing comprehensive evaluations of their ML system codes.

To establish these best practices, we utilized data from ML research papers and recognized online resources. In collaboration with our partner, we researched industrial best practices [@msise2023], [@jordan2020] and academic literature [@openja2023studying], and consolidated testing strategies into a human-readable and machine-friendly checklist that can be embedded into the automated tool.

For development, we collected 11 GitHub repositories of ML projects as studied in [@openja2023studying]. These Python-based projects include comprehensive test suites. Our tool should be able to analyze these test suites, compare them with embedded best practices, and deliver evaluations.

We expect that our approach will provide scalable and reliable test suite evaluations for multiple ML projects. However, we recognize that our current best practices only focus on a few high-priority test areas due to time constraints. We plan to expand this scope in the future. While our tool's evaluations are not yet as reliable as human evaluations, we will quantify its performance.

### Success Metrics

To properly assess the performance of our tool which leverages LLMs capability, we have taken reference of the methods in [@alexander2023evaluating] and defined two success metrics: accuracy and consistency. These metrics will help users (researchers, ML engineers, etc.) gauge the trustworthiness of our tool's evaluation results.

1.  **Accuracy vs Human Expert Judgement**

We run our tool on ML projects from [@openja2023studying] to obtain evaluation results for each ML checklist item. These results are then compared with our manually assessed ground truth data based on the same criteria. Accuracy is calculated as the proportion of matching results to the total number of results.

2.  **Consistency**

We perform multiple runs on each ML project to obtain evaluation results for each checklist item. Consistency is measured by calculating the standard deviation of these results across multiple runs for each project.

## Data Product & Results

### Data Products

Our solution includes a curated checklist for robust ML testing and a Python package for checklist-based evaluation of ML project testing robustness using LLMs. The package is publicly available on the Python Packaging Index (PyPI).

Justifications for these products are:

- Checklists have been shown to reduce errors in software systems and promote code submissions [@Atul2010], [@pineau2021improving].
- Python is widely used in ML, compatible with various OSes, and integrates well with LLMs. These ensure the ease of use and development.

#### How to use the product

There are two ways to make use of this package:

1.  **As a CLI tool.** A runnable command `fixml` is provided by the package. Once installed, users can perform codebase evaluations, generate test function specifications, and more by running subcommands under `fixml` in the terminal.

2.  **As a high-level API.** Users can import necessary components from the package into their own systems. Documentation is available through docstrings.

By offering it as both CLI tool and API, our product is user-friendly to interact with, and versatile to support various use cases such as web application development and scientific research.

#### System Design

Diagram of FixML system design
:::

The design of our package follows object-oriented and SOLID principles, which is fully modularity. Users can easily switch between different prompts, models, and checklists, which facilitates code reusability and collaboration to extend its functionality.

There are five components in the system of our package:

1.  **Code Analyzer** 

It extracts test suites from the input codebase, to ensure only the most relevants details are provided to LLMs given token limits.

2.  **Prompt Templates** 

It stores prompt templates for instructing LLMs to generate responses in the expected format.

3.  **Checklist** 

It reads the curated checklist from a CSV file into a dictionary with a fixed schema for LLM injection. The package includes a default checklist for distribution.

4.  **Runners** 

It includes the Evaluator module, which assesses each test suite file using LLMs and outputs evaluation results, and the Generator module, which creates test specifications. Both modules feature validation, retry logic, and record response and relevant information.

5.  **Parsers** 

It reads the report templates and converts Evaluator's responses into evaluation reports in various formats (QMD, HTML, PDF) using the Jinja template engine, which enables customizable report structures.

#### Checklist Design

The embedded checklist contains best practices for testing ML pipelines, and is curated from ML research and recognized online resources. Prompt engineering is applied to further improve the LLM performance. This helps mitigate LLM hallucinations [@zhang2023sirens] by ensuring strict adherence to the checklist.

### Evaluation Results

As described in `Success Metrics`, we conducted 30 iterations on each repository from [@openja2023studying] and examined the breakdown of the completeness score to assess our tool's evaluation quality. 

1. **Accuracy**

Accuracy is our first consideration as our tool can bring values to users only if its results can generally align with expert judgement. We have targeted 3 of the repositories ([`lightfm`](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm), [`qlib`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib), [`DeepSpeech`](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)) for human evaluation. We then compared and plotted the graph to show how much our tool's outputs align with the ground truth.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-gt
#| tbl-cap: Ground truth scores for 3 repositories per checklist item based on human evaluation. (1 = fully satisfied, 0.5 = partially satisfied, 0 = not satisfied)

import pandas as pd
gt = pd.read_csv('ground_truth.csv')
gt
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-accu-mean-sd-plot
#| fig-cap: Analysis of accuracy of the scores per checklist item. Black dot and line represents the mean and standard deviation of scores from the tool. Green diamond represents the ground truth score of a single repository. It shows our tool tends to underrate satisfying cases.

import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

df_repo__stat = pd.read_csv('score_stat_by_repo_3.5-turbo.csv')
gt = pd.read_csv('ground_truth.csv')
gt = gt.melt(id_vars=['id', 'title'], var_name='repo', value_name='ground_truth')

df_repo__stat_with_gt = df_repo__stat.merge(gt, on=['id', 'title', 'repo'])

base = alt.Chart(
    df_repo__stat_with_gt.query('repo in ["lightfm", "qlib", "DeepSpeech"]')
).transform_calculate(
    min="max(0, datum.mean-datum.std)",
    max="min(1, datum.mean+datum.std)"
)
    
# generate the points
points = base.mark_point(
    filled=True,
    size=50,
    color='black'
).encode(
    x=alt.X('mean:Q').scale(domainMin=0, domainMax=1).title("Score").axis(
        labelExpr="datum.value % 0.5 ? null : datum.label"
    ),
    y=alt.Y('id_title:N', title=None, axis=alt.Axis(labelPadding=10, labelLimit=1000, grid=False))#.scale(domainMin=0, domainMax=1).title('Score'),
)

# generate the points for ground truth
gt_points = base.mark_point(
    filled=True,
    size=200,
    color='green',
    shape="diamond"
).encode(
    x=alt.X('ground_truth:Q'),
    y=alt.Y('id_title:N')
)

# generate the error bars
errorbars = base.mark_errorbar().encode(
    x=alt.X("min:Q").title('1 SD'), #"id:N",
    x2="max:Q",
    y="id_title:N"
)

(gt_points + points + errorbars).facet(
    column=alt.Column('repo:N').title(None)
).configure_axis( 
    labelFontSize=12, 
    titleFontSize=12
)
```

When we examined the accuracy, we have observed that our tool can identify non-satisfying cases quite well. Yet, it often classifies fully satisfied items as partially satisfied and partially satisfied items as not satisfied.

It is shown that our tool attains certain degree of accuracy. The next questions we asked are:

- Is there any other consideration in the performance of our tool?
- In what direction can we improve our tool?

2. **Consistency**

Consistency is another consideration because it directly links to the reliability of the evaluation results from user perspective. As the completeness scores from LLMs contain randomness, we plotted graphs of the uncertainty of completeness scores across checklist items and all the repositories to show how consistent these results were.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cons-sd-box-plot
#| fig-cap: Analysis of uncertainty of the scores (in standard deviation, scale of 0 - 1) per checklist item. Each dot represents the uncertainty of scores from 30 runs of a single repository. It shows different patterns across checklist items.

stds = df_repo__stat[['repo', 'std', 'id_title']].pivot(index='repo', columns='id_title').copy()
stds.columns = [col[1] for col in stds.columns]
stds = stds.reset_index()
stds = stds.melt(id_vars='repo', var_name='id_title')

base = alt.Chart(stds)

box = base.mark_boxplot(
    color='grey',
    opacity=0.5,
    size=20,
).encode(
    x=alt.X('value:Q').title('Standard Deviation of Scores'),
    y=alt.Y('id_title:N', title=None, axis=alt.Axis(labelPadding=10, labelLimit=1000, grid=False))
)

stripplot = base.mark_circle(size=100).encode(
    y=alt.Y( 
        'id_title:N',
        axis=alt.Axis(ticks=False, grid=True, labels=True), 
        scale=alt.Scale(), 
    ), 
    x='value:Q',
    yOffset="jitter:Q",
    color=alt.Color('id_title:N', legend=None),
    tooltip='repo'
).transform_calculate(
    # Generate Gaussian jitter with a Box-Muller transform
    jitter="sqrt(-2*log(random()))*cos(2*PI*random())"
)

(
    box + stripplot
).configure_view( 
    stroke=None
).configure_axis( 
    labelFontSize=12, 
    titleFontSize=12
).properties(
    height=300, 
    width=600,
    title="30 Runs on Openja's Repositories for each Checklist Item"
) 
```

When we examined the consistency, we have observed various patterns and tried to deduce the reasons, which could provide ideas for future improvement. To conclude, we have identified two categories that show diverging patterns:

i. **High Uncertainty** 

Items like `6.1 Verify Evaluation Metrics Implementation` showed high standard deviations across repositories (median = 0.12). This might indicate potential poor prompt quality for the LLM to produce consistent results. Improved prompt engineering could address this issue.

ii. **Outliers with High Uncertainty**

Items like `2.1 Ensure Data File Loads as Expected` had outliers with exceptionally high standard deviations, which is possibly due to unorthodox repositories. A careful manual examination is required for a more definitive conclusion.

#### Comparison of `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4o`

To evaluate if newer LLMs improve performance, we preliminarily compared outputs from `gpt-4o` and `gpt-3.5-turbo` on the `lightfm` repository. We observed that `gpt-4o` consistently returned "Satisfied," which deviated from the ground truth.

```{python}
#| label: fig-llm-mean-sd-plot
#| fig-cap: Comparison of satisfaction using `gpt-4o` versus `gpt-3.5-turbo` for each checklist item on `lightfm`

df_repo_4o__stat = pd.read_csv('score_stat_by_repo_4o.csv')
df_repo_4o__stat_with_gt = df_repo_4o__stat.merge(gt, on=['id', 'title', 'repo'])
df_repo_4o__stat_with_gt['model'] = 'gpt-4o'

df_repo_35turbo__stat_with_gt = df_repo__stat_with_gt.query("repo == 'lightfm'").copy()
df_repo_35turbo__stat_with_gt['model'] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'

df_model_comp = pd.concat(
    (df_repo_35turbo__stat_with_gt, df_repo_4o__stat_with_gt), 
    axis=0
)

base = alt.Chart(
    df_model_comp
).transform_calculate(
    min="max(0, datum.mean-datum.std)",
    max="min(1, datum.mean+datum.std)"
)
    
# generate the points
points = base.mark_point(
    filled=True,
    size=50,
    color='black'
).encode(
    x=alt.X('mean:Q').scale(domainMin=0, domainMax=1).title("Score").axis(
        labelExpr="datum.value % 0.5 ? null : datum.label"
    ),
    y=alt.Y('id_title:N', title=None, axis=alt.Axis(labelPadding=10, labelLimit=1000, grid=False))#.scale(domainMin=0, domainMax=1).title('Score'),
)

# generate the points for ground truth
gt_points = base.mark_point(
    filled=True,
    size=200,
    color='green',
    shape="diamond"
).encode(
    x=alt.X('ground_truth:Q'),
    y=alt.Y('id_title:N')
)

# generate the error bars
errorbars = base.mark_errorbar().encode(
    x=alt.X("min:Q").title('1 SD'), #"id:N",
    x2="max:Q",
    y="id_title:N"
)

(gt_points + points + errorbars).facet(
    column=alt.Column('model:N').title(None)
).configure_axis( 
    labelFontSize=12, 
    titleFontSize=12
)
```

Further investigation into `gpt-4o` is required to determine its effectiveness in system performance.

## Conclusion

### Wrap Up

The development of FixML has been driven by the need of better quality assurance in ML systems and the current limitations of traditional testing methods on ML projects. FixML provides curated checklists and automated tools that enhance the evaluation and creation of test suites for ML projects. This in return, significantly reduces the time and effort required to assess the completeness of ML test suites, and thus promotes thorough and efficient assessment on ML projects.

### Limitation & Future Improvement

While FixML provides substantial benefits, there are limitations and areas to be addressed in future development:

1.  **Specialized Checklist**

The default checklist is general and may not cover all requirements for different ML projects. However, the current checklist structure allows users to edit checklist easily (shown in [@tbl-checklist-schema]). Future development will focus on creating specialized checklists for tailored evaluations across various domains and project types. Collaboration with ML researchers is welcomed for creating specialized checklists based on specific use cases.

2.  **Enhanced Test Evaluator**

Our study reveals the accuracy and consistency issues on the evaluation results using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model (see [Comparison of our system’s satisfaction determination versus the ground truth for each checklist item and repository](#fig-accu-mean-sd-plot) and [Standard deviations of the score for each checklist item. Each dot represents the standard deviation of scores from 30 runs of a single repository](#fig-cons-sd-box-plot)). Future improvements involves better prompt engineering techniques and support for multiple LLMs for enhanced performance and flexibility. User guidelines in prompt creation will be provided to facilitate collaboration with ML developers.

3.  **Customized Test Specification**

The current generator produces general test function skeletons and does not integrate specific details for the projects (see[General test specification.](#fig-testspec)).Future developments will integrate project-specific information to produce customized test function skeletons. This may further encourage users to create comprehensive tests.

4.  Workflow Optimization 

The test evaluator and test specification generator are currently separate (see [System design.](#system-design)). Future improvements could embed a workflow engine that automatically takes actions based on LLM responses. This creates a more cohesive and efficient workflow, recues manual intervention, and improves overall system performance.

By addressing these limitations and implementing future improvements, we aim for FixML to achieve better performance and contribute to the development of better ML systems, and ultimately enhance human life.
